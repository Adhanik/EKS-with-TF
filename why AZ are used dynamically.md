Passing Availability Zones (AZs) using a data source like `data.aws_availability_zones.available.names` instead of hard-coding them as `["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]` is considered good practice in Terraform for several reasons:

### 1. **Dynamic Selection and Future-Proofing**
   - **Hard-Coded AZs**: If you hard-code AZs, your configuration is fixed to those specific AZs. If AWS adds, removes, or renames AZs in the region, your Terraform code will not automatically adapt, potentially leading to issues during deployment or updates.
   - **Dynamic AZs**: Using `data.aws_availability_zones.available.names` allows your configuration to automatically pick up all available AZs in the region. If there are changes in the AZs provided by AWS, your Terraform code will adapt without requiring manual updates.

### 2. **Portability Across Regions**
   - **Hard-Coded AZs**: If you want to reuse your Terraform configuration in another region, you would have to manually update the AZs to match those available in that region, which is prone to error and increases maintenance effort.
   - **Dynamic AZs**: By using a data source, the Terraform configuration becomes more portable. The same code can be deployed in different regions, and it will automatically select the appropriate AZs for each region without any modification.

### 3. **Resilience to Changes**
   - **Hard-Coded AZs**: If an AZ becomes unavailable or is deprecated by AWS, your configuration may break or fail to deploy correctly.
   - **Dynamic AZs**: The data source will only return AZs that are currently in an "available" state. This means your infrastructure is more resilient to changes, as it won't rely on AZs that might be temporarily unavailable or permanently removed.

### 4. **Consistency Across Environments**
   - **Hard-Coded AZs**: If you have multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) in different regions or accounts, hard-coding AZs can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
   - **Dynamic AZs**: Using the data source ensures consistent behavior across environments, as Terraform will always fetch the currently available AZs for the specified region.

### 5. **Easier Maintenance**
   - **Hard-Coded AZs**: Any changes to AZs would require manual intervention and testing to ensure they are still valid.
   - **Dynamic AZs**: Since the data source automatically reflects the current state of the region's AZs, maintenance is reduced, and the infrastructure is always in sync with AWS's current configuration.

### Summary:
Using `data.aws_availability_zones.available.names` in Terraform modules is a best practice because it provides dynamic, adaptable, and resilient infrastructure code. It reduces the risk of errors, ensures consistency across different environments, and requires less maintenance as the infrastructure evolves.
