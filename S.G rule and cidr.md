# Why we did not use aws_security_group_rule instead of aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule ??

So in tf documentation it is mentioned that Avoid using the aws_security_group_rule resource, 
as it struggles with managing multiple CIDR blocks, and, due to the historical lack of unique IDs, 
tags and descriptions. 

To avoid these problems, use the current best practice of the aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule and 
aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule resources with one CIDR block per rule. 

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_worker_mgmt_ingress" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.all_worker.id
  cidr_ipv4         = "10.0.0.0/8"
  from_port         = 0
  ip_protocol       = "-1"
  to_port           = 0
  description       = "allow inbound traffic from EKS (10.0.0.0/8)"
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_worker_mgmt_ingress_2" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.all_worker.id
  cidr_ipv4         = "172.16.0.0/12"
  from_port         = 0
  ip_protocol       = "-1"
  to_port           = 0
  description       = "allow inbound traffic from EKS (172.16.0.0/12)"
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_worker_mgmt_ingress_3" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.all_worker.id
  cidr_ipv4         = "192.168.0.0/16"
  from_port         = 0
  ip_protocol       = "-1"
  to_port           = 0
  description       = "allow inbound traffic from EKS (192.168.0.0/16)"
}



The recommendation to use one CIDR block per rule in security groups is based on the principle of **granularity** and **manageability**. However, it's not strictly necessary, and there are trade-offs to consider. Here's why you might want to follow this practice, and also why it might be acceptable not to:

### Why Use One CIDR Block Per Rule?

1. **Granular Control**:
   - **Isolate Changes**: If you need to modify or delete a specific CIDR block later, having it in a separate rule allows you to do so without affecting other rules.
   - **Clarity**: Each rule is clear and concise, making it easier for others (or your future self) to understand exactly which CIDR blocks are allowed.

2. **Avoiding Potential Issues**:
   - **Terraform State**: Managing multiple CIDR blocks in a single rule can sometimes cause issues with Terraform state. For example, if you update one CIDR block, Terraform might need to recreate the entire rule, which can cause disruptions.
   - **Tagging**: In some cases, you might want to apply specific tags or descriptions to different rules. This is only possible if the rules are separated.

3. **Compatibility**:
   - **Future-Proofing**: AWS might change how rules are handled, or you might need to integrate with other systems that require separate rules.

### Why It Might Be Acceptable to Combine CIDR Blocks:

1. **Code Simplicity**:
   - **Less Code**: Combining CIDR blocks in one rule reduces the amount of code you need to write and maintain. This can be important in large configurations.
   - **Easier Maintenance**: With fewer lines of code, there's less to manage, making it simpler in some scenarios.

2. **No Immediate Need for Granularity**:
   - **Static Environments**: If your environment is relatively static, and you don't anticipate needing to modify rules often, combining CIDR blocks might be more practical.
   - **Performance**: In some cases, having fewer rules might slightly improve performance, though this is generally negligible.

### Summary:
- **Best Practice**: Use one CIDR block per rule if you prioritize granularity, manageability, and future-proofing.
- **Practical Approach**: Combine CIDR blocks if you want to keep your code concise and your environment doesn't require granular control.

The decision ultimately depends on your specific use case, project complexity, and future maintenance considerations. If you feel that combining CIDR blocks works better for your project, it's perfectly fine to do so.
